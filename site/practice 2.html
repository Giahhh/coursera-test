<h1 id="top">Kaguya-sama Love is War</h1>

<p>Considered a genius due to having the highest grades in the country, Miyuki Shirogane leads the prestigious Shuchiin Academy's student council as its president, working alongside the beautiful and wealthy vice president Kaguya Shinomiya. The two are often regarded as the perfect couple by students despite them not being in any sort of romantic relationship. However, the truth is that after spending so much time together, the two have developed feelings for one another; unfortunately, neither is willing to confess, as doing so would be a sign of weakness. With their pride as elite students on the line, Miyuki and Kaguya embark on a quest to do whatever is necessary to get a confession out of the other. Through their daily antics, the battle of love begins! </p>

	<p>
		Kaguya Shinomiya (四宮しのみや かぐや, Shinomiya Kaguya?) is the main protagonist and the titular character of the Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai series. She is a third-year high school student at Shuchi'in Academy[3], a member of the Archery Club, and the Vice President of the 67th and 68th Student Council.

		Kaguya is a beautiful, fair-skinned young girl with long black hair that is usually tied by a black-red ribbon (her hair appears to be mid-back length when she lets it down) with bangs/hair strands hanging on either side, large, almond-shaped red eyes (that can look sharper, depending on her mood), thin eyebrows and a slim, but feminine build, with a noticeably small chest. She is described in her manga character profile as possessing 'stunning beauty'.

In the past, and at the beginning of her time in the Student Council, she always wore her hair down, without her iconic red ribbon. As 'The Ice Princess', her eyes appeared sharper, darker, and lifeless, giving her the aura of a gloomy, cold, unapproachable, and unattainable beauty. This reflected her mental state, influenced by her ruthlessly strict upbringing, where she acted cold towards others, pushing them away because she feared hurting others.

Later, as she became closer to the other members of the Student Council, (in particular, Miyuki Shirogane) and other students, she asks her maid Ai Hayasaka to make her "cute". The ribbon is her attempt at making appear less imposing and cold to others and marks a shift in her personality. Rather than coldly pushing and distancing herself from others, she starts to form meaningful relationships and becomes brighter, cuter, and happier overall. This change is particularly reflected in her eyes, which no longer looked vacant and distant. Now, her eyes appear wider and livelier.

She is typically dressed in the Shuchi'in school uniform.

		Miyuki Shirogane (白しろ銀がね 御み行ゆき, Shirogane Miyuki?) is the deuteragonist and male protagonist in the Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai series. He is a third-year high school student at Shuchi'in Academy[4] and the president of the 67th and 68th Student Council.

		Miyuki is a handsome young man with blonde hair, dark blue sanpaku eyes with long eyelashes. Due to his constant sleep deprivation and nearsightedness, his eyes appear to glare, and he constantly appears to look a little tired, with bags/ dark circles under his eyes.

He usually wears the regular Shuchi'in Academy black male uniform adorned with the Aiguilette, the golden chain-like accessory around his neck that is passed down by the previous generations of the Shuchi'in Academy presidents as per his authority as the student council president.

	<p>
		Chika is based on Kuramochi no Miko (車持 皇子), the second suitor from The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter who was tasked with finding the Jeweled Branch from Hourai. Her habit of cheating during games is based on the fact that her counterpart attempted to present Princess Kaguya with a forgery.[4] Everyone in her family has plant-based names that reference the branch in some way.

Chika's surname "Fujiwara" is based on the actual real-life Fujiwara clan who were important figures in Japanese Politics throughout history.

		Chika is a cute fair-skinned young girl with shoulder-length silver hair (light pink in the anime) that has a black bow in the middle of her square bangs, blue eyes and she has a larger chest size despite being shorter than Kaguya Shinomiya. She sometimes ties her hair in a slightly high ponytail.

She is usually dressed in a Shuchi'in Academy high school uniform.

	<p>
	Yu Ishigami (石上 優いしがみ ゆう, Ishigami Yu) is one of the protagonists in the Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai series. He is a second-year high school student at Shuchi'in Academy, a former member of the Cheer Club, and the current treasurer of the high school Student Council.

	Ishigami is based on Isonokami no Maro (石上 麻呂), the fifth suitor from The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. His depressed personality is based on the fact that his counterpart attempted to obtain a cowry shell from a swallow's nest, only to fall to his death with bird poop in his hand.

	Ishigami is a good-looking, albeit gloomy, teenage boy of a slim build. He has chin-length black hair that covers the left side of his face; he typically wears a dull expression further amplified by his black eyes.

In the past, Ishigami described himself as being a jock. He had an athletic build and short hair that resembled Tsubasa's. However, years of inactivity led him to lose his muscle.

		Miko Iino (伊井野 ミコいいの みこ, Iino Miko) is one of the protagonists in the Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai series. She is a second-year high school student at Shuchi'in Academy, a member of the Public Morals Committee, and the current auditor of the Student Council.

		Miko was based off on Ishidzukuri no Miko (石作 皇子), the first suitor from The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, who had been tasked with collecting the Stone Begging Bowl of the Buddha.

		Miko is a short, petite young girl with brown eyes and long brown hair that is styled in loose pigtails, with bangs covering her forehead. When in Shuchi'in Academy high school uniform, she wears black tights and a yellow armband on her left arm to distinguish herself as a member of the Public Morals Committee.
