			As a spy, his personality is very cold and efficient for his job, doing whatever it takes to complete the mission, from joining terrorist organizations to dating his target's daughter to becoming a father. However, he is shown to have a kind personality as shown when he rescued Anya Forger, even risking his identity as a spy.

Loid's past as a powerless war orphan, feeling despair and isolation, has seemingly stuck with him into his adult years and becomes his motivation as a spy to create a world where children wouldn't have to cry. He sincerely empathizes with Yor Forger about sacrificing themselves for the sake of others and their beliefs, becoming the deciding factor for Yor's decision to marry him.

Contrasting his current personality and profession as a spy, he was an honest child and rarely lied to his parents. When he did lie to his father to trick his father into giving him pocket money to buy a soldier set, he quickly felt guilty for lying, almost confessing to his father immediately afterwards, and wishing to work for money to pay his father back. After his dad's disappearance during the Ostanian raid of his hometown, he felt even more guilty about his lie and vowed to tell his father the truth when he would return.

		<p>
			Yor is a young woman with fair skin, long black hair and upturned red eyes. She splits her hair into two parts and crosses it over her head, securing it with a headband and forming two thick locks of hair that reach below her chest.[6] When her hair is let down, she lacks the usual two thick locks of hair and her hair reaches about mid-back.

Yor wears a red off-shoulder sweater with black tights and brown-heeled ankle boots. She wears a white headband and a pair of dangling gold earrings in the shape of small spikes. When going outside, she wears a long beige coat with black buttons over her clothes.

At Berlint City Hall, she wears the standard work uniform, consisting of a white long-sleeved shirt with a sleeveless green vest over it, with a knee-length green office skirt and black heels.

As an assassin, Yor wears a form-fitting halter-style black dress that shows off her shoulders and cleavage, with a rose choker and a red rose pattern on the inside of her skirt. The front of the skirt is mid-thigh length while the back of the skirt reaches below her knees. She also wears a pair of black thigh-high boots and black fingerless gloves. The headband she wears is gold-colored with a rose and two spikes on each side. Her weapons are of the same color as well. She also wears this dress for formal occasions as it is her only good dress.

		Anya is a short young girl with fair skin and green eyes. Loid describes her as appearing about four to five years old at the oldest.[8] Her green eyes are large and oval-shaped with prominent eyelashes. She has shoulder-length, light pink hair that curls inwards with a fringe that reaches just above her eyes. Anya is noticeably shorter than most of her peers and many of the insults Damian and his friends direct at her target her small size.

Anya wears a simple black dress with a white ribbon at the front, along with white folded-down socks and black shoes. She also wears two black hair ornaments with bright yellow embellishments that resemble small horns on the sides of her head. Anya is never seen with her hair ornaments off, even wearing them to sleep.

At Eden Academy, Anya wears the standard uniform with white knee-high socks and black Mary Janes. She carries around a brown schoolbag with a sheep keychain attached. During physical education class, Anya also ties her hair back with a red headband and wears the school gym uniform, along with white socks and white gym shoes.

When she was younger, her hair was slightly shorter and she did not wear the horn-like hair ornaments, instead, her hair was tied into small buns at the sides of her head. She also wore clothing that resembled scrubs.
